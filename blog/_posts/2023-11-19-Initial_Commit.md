Hello! If you're reading this, that means my site is up!

I'm still working on it, so expect some things to be a little funky. 

This site is made in Jekyll with a custom theme! Before making this, I had no idea that Jekyll could be this powerful. I'm using a pagination plugin for the blog page and navigation for it.

You can find the repo for this site here at [diademiemi/diademiemi.me](https://github.com/diademiemi/diademiemi.me)! I'm using GitHub Actions to build and deploy the site to GitHub Pages.

Right now I don't have a lot of content on this site, but I'm planning on expanding the projects page and adding more blog posts.

Right now, you can find a list of all my Ansible content, with CI status on [the Ansible page](/projects/ansible).
