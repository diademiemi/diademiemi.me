Hi! On this page you'll find more information about me, my interests and my certifications.

## About Me
My name is Jasmine, or Emilia. I'm from the Netherlands and work as DevOps Engineer, where I mostly manage Linux servers and automating them with tools such as Ansible, Terraform and Kubernetes.

I code in my free time, mostly in Kotlin, Python and misusing Ansible. I have a homelab using Ansible, Terraform, Rancher, Kubernetes, Fleet, ArgoCD and more tools. I like to learn tools by using them, and I like to put what I use to learn online, so others can learn from it too.

Of course, I also like to play games, my favourite genre is RPGs and anything story-driven that can make me cry. Some of my favourite games include OneShot, Undertale, Deltarune, OMORI, Goodbye Volcano High, Celeste, all the Xenoblade Chronicles games and more!

I also play Minecraft to toy with the internals, and write plugins for Spigot servers! You can find these on my [Projects page](/projects).

You can contact me at my email address, <a href="mailto:emilia@diademiemi.me">emilia@diademiemi.me</a>!

## Certifications
Below you'll find a list of my certifications, and when I got them! Whenever I get a new certification, I'll update this page.

You can also find certifications I'm working on, along with training material I use to study for them, on my [GitHub certifications repository](https://github.com/diademiemi/certifications)
